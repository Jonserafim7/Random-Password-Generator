## Key Takeaways

### 1. DOM Manipulation
- Learned how to dynamically update HTML content using JavaScript.
- Used methods like `document.getElementById()` and `textContent` to interact with and update elements on the page.

### 2. Event Handling
- Gained experience with JavaScript event listeners to handle user interactions, such as button clicks and input changes.
- Implemented functions that are triggered by user actions to control the application flow.

### 3. Form and Input Handling
- Developed skills in handling form inputs, including range sliders and checkboxes.
- Ensured proper synchronization between different input elements (e.g., number input and range slider).

### 4. Random Number and Character Generation
- Used JavaScript's `Math.random()` function to generate random characters for the passwords.
- Implemented logic to handle different character sets (alphabets, numbers, special characters).

### 5. Conditional Logic
- Applied conditional logic to include or exclude numbers and special characters based on user preferences.
- Ensured the generated passwords meet the specified criteria.

### 6. CSS Styling
